# What is Kong?

Kong is a scalable, open source API Platform (also known as an API Gateway, or API Middleware, or Service Mesh for Microservices). Kong was originally built by [Kong Inc.](https://konghq.com) (formerly known as Mashape) to secure, manage and extend over 15,000 Microservices for its API Marketplace, which generates billions of requests per month.

Under active development, Kong is now used in production at hundreds of organizations from startups, to large enterprises and governments including: The New York Times, Expedia, Healthcare.gov, The Guardian, Condè Nast, The University of Auckland, Ferrari, Rakuten, Cisco, SkyScanner, Yahoo! Japan, Giphy and so on.

Kong's official documentation can be found at [docs.konghq.com](https://docs.konghq.com/).

# How to use this image

First, Kong requires a running Cassandra cluster (3.x+) or PostgreSQL instance (9.6+) before it starts. You can either use the official Cassandra/PostgreSQL containers, or use your own.

## 1. Link Kong to either a Cassandra or PostgreSQL container

It's up to you to decide which datastore between Cassandra or PostgreSQL you want to use, since Kong supports both.

### Cassandra

Start a Cassandra container by executing:

```shell
$ docker run -d --name kong-database \
                -p 9042:9042 \
                cassandra:3
```

### Postgres

Start a PostgreSQL container by executing:

```shell
docker run -d --name kong-database \
                -p 5432:5432 \
                -e "POSTGRES_USER=kong" \
                -e "POSTGRES_DB=kong" \
                postgres:9.6
```

## 2. Prepare your database

Run the database migrations with an ephemeral Kong container:

```shell
docker run --rm \
    --link kong-database:kong-database \
    -e "KONG_DATABASE=postgres" \
    -e "KONG_PG_HOST=kong-database" \
    -e "KONG_CASSANDRA_CONTACT_POINTS=kong-database" \
    arm64v8/kong kong migrations bootstrap
```

In the above example, both Cassandra and PostgreSQL are configured, but you should update the `KONG_DATABASE` environment variable with either `cassandra` or `postgres`.

**Note for Kong < 0.15**: with Kong versions below 0.15 (up to 0.14), use the `up` sub-command instead of `bootstrap`. Also note that with Kong < 0.15, migrations should never be run concurrently; only one Kong node should be performing migrations at a time. This limitation is lifted for Kong 0.15, 1.0, and above.

### Start Kong

Once the database has been started and prepared, we can start a Kong container and link it to the database container, and configuring the `KONG_DATABASE` environment variable with either `cassandra` or `postgres` depending on which database you decided to use:

```shell
$ docker run -d --name kong \
    --link kong-database:kong-database \
    -e "KONG_DATABASE=postgres" \
    -e "KONG_PG_HOST=kong-database" \
    -e "KONG_CASSANDRA_CONTACT_POINTS=kong-database" \
    -e "KONG_PROXY_ACCESS_LOG=/dev/stdout" \
    -e "KONG_ADMIN_ACCESS_LOG=/dev/stdout" \
    -e "KONG_PROXY_ERROR_LOG=/dev/stderr" \
    -e "KONG_ADMIN_ERROR_LOG=/dev/stderr" \
    -e "KONG_ADMIN_LISTEN=0.0.0.0:8001, 0.0.0.0:8444 ssl" \
    -p 8000:8000 \
    -p 8443:8443 \
    -p 8001:8001 \
    -p 8444:8444 \
    arm64v8/kong
```

If everything went well, and if you created your container with the default ports, Kong should be listening on your host's `8000` ([Proxy](https://docs.konghq.com/latest/configuration/#proxy_port)), `8443` ([Proxy SSL](https://docs.konghq.com/latest/configuration/#proxy_listen_ssl)), `8001` ([Admin API](https://docs.konghq.com/latest/configuration/#admin_listen)) and `8444` ([Admin API SSL](https://docs.konghq.com/latest/configuration/#admin_listen_ssl)) ports.

You can now read the docs at [docs.konghq.com](https://docs.konghq.com/) to learn more about Kong.

## 3. Use Kong with a custom configuration (and a custom Cassandra/PostgreSQL cluster)

You can override any property of the [Kong configuration file](https://docs.konghq.com/latest/configuration/) with environment variables. Just prepend any Kong configuration property with the `KONG_` prefix, for example:

```shell
$ docker run -d --name kong \
    -e "KONG_DATABASE=postgres"
    -e "KONG_PG_HOST=kong-database" \
    -e "KONG_LOG_LEVEL=info" \
    -e "KONG_CUSTOM_PLUGINS=helloworld" \
    -e "KONG_PG_HOST=1.1.1.1" \
    -e "KONG_ADMIN_LISTEN=0.0.0.0:8001, 0.0.0.0:8444 ssl" \
    -p 8000:8000 \
    -p 8443:8443 \
    -p 8001:8001 \
    -p 8444:8444 \
    arm64v8/kong
```

## Reload Kong in a running container

If you change your custom configuration, you can reload Kong (without downtime) by issuing:

```shell
$ docker exec -it kong kong reload
```

This will run the [`kong reload`](https://docs.konghq.com/latest/cli/#reload) command in your container.

# Kubernetes Ingress

Among the many deployment options [available](https://konghq.com/install), Kong also offers a [Kubernetes Ingress Controller](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller) ready to use in your K8S environment.

# Service Mesh

Since version 1.x you can run Kong in a Service Mesh deployment as a platform-agnostic sidecar proxy (including Kubernetes, but also on any other platform supported by Kong). To get started and learn more you can read the docs at:

-	[Streams and Service Mesh](https://docs.konghq.com/latest/streams-and-service-mesh/)
